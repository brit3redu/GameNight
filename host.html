        <h1>How to Host Game Night</h1> 
            <h2>Planning Your Game Night:</h2>
                <p>Planning your game night doesn't have to be complicated. In fact, making it complicated will likely take the fun out of it for the host and remember, this should be a fun night for everyone! 
                    While it doesn't need to be complicated there are some important things to consider. Here are things to consider:
                    <ul>
                        <li>How many people to invite</li>
                        <li>Choosing the right game for your guests</li>
                        <li>Setting up the perfect atmosphere</li>
                        <li>The food and drinks you will be providing to guests</li>
                    </ul>
            <h2>How many people?</h2>
                <p>It's important to think about what games you plan to play before choosing how many people to invite to game night. 5-8 seems to be the ideal number. It might seem like this is not a lot of people 
                    but the purpose of game night is to be fun. If there are too many people some may get bored waiting for their turn, may feel unincluded or may not have a place to sit. While they do exist, it's 
                    hard to find many exciting games that can be played by more than 8 people. </p>
            <h2>Choosing The Games</h2>
                <p>Make sure that before your guests arrive you have games already picked out. Knowing about each of your games and familiarizing yourself with the rules beforehand is very important. There are some 
                    complicated games that are a ton of fun but if no one knows how to play can quickly become a bother. You don't want to have to be learning the rules while pulling off a successful game night and 
                    have guest sitting around waiting for you. They will lose interest and likely not want to participate in the future. </p>
            <h2>Setting The Space</h2>
                <p>Depending upon what your space looks like before hand you may have to adjust some furniture to make sure your guests stay comfortable throughout the night. Guests will likely be sitting in the 
                    same place all night so try to make it comfortable for them. I wouldn't suggest hosting a board game, game night for instance if you don't have a table for the game. </p>
            <h2>Food</h2>
                <p>If you want to have a great night, make sure to feed your guests. Finger foods are great for game night and guest can grab small bites in between turns. Just make sure to have plenty of napkins. 
                    Whatever you do, DO NOT serve Cheetos. No one wants Cheetos dust all over their game pieces. In our group we try to keep it semi healthy so if you need some ideas hop on over to the recipes
