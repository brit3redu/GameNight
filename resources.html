        <h1>Resources</h1>
        <h2>Game Bit Trays</h2>
        <p>These trays can really be useful for games like Mansions of Madness that have many different components that you need to have readily available.<p>
        <h2>Player Dashboards</h2>
        <img src="images/player_dashboard.png" alt="Player Dashboard" style="width:300px;height:auto;">
        <p>Some games are enhanced by having a player dashboard to keep all of the players items together. These can be harder to come by and you may need to get creative. I personally plan to 3D print custom Mansions of Madness player dashboards and you could do the same. The dashboard shown here is one that comes with Zombicide Black Plague. Most games will not come with these but I think it's nice that this one comes with them although they could be improved.</p>
        <h2>Dice Tower</h2>
        <p>You may want to invest in a dice tower to make sure that dice is rolled fairly. Dice dropped into these towers bounce off of different hidden platforms inside before coming out of the front of the tower. These Dice Towers can eliminate some cheating which could happen when rolling dice by hand. Even more so, Dice Towers can keep wild rollers die contained so that they do not mess up loose board game elements. Some board games have elements that if moved slightly could mess up gameplay so a dice tower could help prevent this issue.</p>
        <h2>Dice Tray</h2>
        <p>A dice tray is simply just a tray for players to roll their dice into. This doesn't prevent any cheating like the Dice Tower would but if you're like our group cheating isn't high on our list as we play with a pretty honest group. These dice trays will however still help with the erratic rollers of the group and help keep board elements in place.</p> 
        <h2>Ceramic Ramakins</h2>
        <p>You may have seen over on the recipe page that dips are a good game night snack. These ceramic ramakins are perfect for making your dips ahead of time and storing them. The convenient silicon lids will make post game night cleanup super quick!</p>
